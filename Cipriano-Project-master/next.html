Hello, My name is Cristina. I am a senior psychology student at the University of New Haven. During my time here, I took an opportunity of a life time - I studied abroad. If the opportunity presents itself to you, take it. It will be the most worthwhile thing you could ever do during your time in college. Whether you're in college or not - you can still travel. That doesn't mean pack up a bag and get on a plane. It goes beyond that and you need to be willing to fully emerse yourself in the destination you're headed. This is what makes traveling so addicting and exciting. It's about learning new cultures, engaging in new activites, and trying foreign things. Once you start to fully appreciate the beauty of traveling, you will find a new passion. Within this website, I will tell you about the countries I've been, tips to traveling, and where I am heading next. Hope you enjoy it!
